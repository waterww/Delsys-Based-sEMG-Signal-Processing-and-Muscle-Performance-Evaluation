# Delsys-Based-sEMG-Signal-Processing-and-Muscle-Performance-Evaluation

sEMG signal is the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles, which is used to predict muscle's condition. Muscle contraction and muscle fatigue can be detected by sEMG signal. 
In this project, I use Delsys Trigno Wireless System to collect sEMG signal and evaluate muscle performance, like muscle force and muscle fatigue in yoga. This could be used to guide user to perform better during sports.
